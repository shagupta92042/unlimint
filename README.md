**TEST CASE2:**

Problems with the https://randomuser.me/api/ generated data.
1. Password generated through randomuser api is not accepted by https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/customer/account/create/ as it does not pass validation therefore a passord has been set in app.properties which will be used for account creation.
2. Intermittent issue : Sometimes the state data generated by random user API is not available in magneto website but I have managed to handle this case in UI code.


**Prerequisites :**
Java , maven and chromedriver must be there . Check your chrome version and download or place the chromedriver in drivers folder. Current version used is 106.
As of now I have configured only chrome browser.

**How to Run:**
To run  the test case execute below command
mvn clean test -Dxml="test1.xml"

You can also run the test cases from "RegisterAndOrderTest" class.
